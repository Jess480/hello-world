How GitHub Works
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

The Essentials
Repositories
Branhces
Commits
Pull Requests

Repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

Commits are saved changes. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
